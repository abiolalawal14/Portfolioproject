-- Regional Performance Analysis of Airlines

-- Business Context:
-- The airline industry is regionally diverse, and profitability can vary significantly by region. 
-- As an analyst, youâ€™re tasked with helping leadership identify which regions are operating most efficiently and profitably.

-- Problem Statement:

-- Perform a comparative analysis across regions to determine which region has the most efficient and profitable airlines, 
-- using the following metrics:
-- Average EBIT (USD)

SELECT

    ROUND(AVG(ebit_usd),2) AS avg_ebit_usd

-- Average Load Factor
SELECT

    ROUND(AVG(load_factor),2) AS avg_load_factor
FROM
    airline_data

-- Average Passenger Yield
SELECT

FROM
    airline_data

-- Which region has the best overall balance across profitability and operational efficiency?
