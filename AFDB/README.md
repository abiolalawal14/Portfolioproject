## 📂 Dataset & Methodology
The dataset contained AfDB project portfolio data, including:  
- **Project counts, commitments, disbursements, and completion status**  
- **Regional allocations** (Central, East, North, Southern, West Africa, and “None”)  
- **High 5 themes** for project classification

**Steps taken:**  
- 🔹 **Data Cleaning (Excel):** Standardized region names, cleaned missing values, structured financial figures  
- 🔹 **Data Modeling (Excel):** Built pivot tables and structured data for Power BI ingestion  
- 🔹 **Dashboarding (Power BI):** Designed visuals to show disbursement flows, delays, completion rates, and thematic allocations

## 🔎 Key Insights

### 🌍 Regional Funding & High 5 Themes
- **Feed Africa:** Top funding in **West Africa ($6.2bn)** and **North Africa ($5bn)**  
- **Quality of Life:** Largest allocations to **East Africa ($18bn)** and **North Africa ($16.5bn)**  
- **Industrialize Africa & Integrate Africa:** Steady contributions across multiple regions  
- A significant “None” bucket indicates unclassified commitments (~$2.6–4.7bn), highlighting a data attribution gap

### ⏱️ Project Delivery & Delays
- **6,000 projects** in total → **~4,000 completed**, **941 delayed**  
- **Completion rate:** **77.3%**  
- **Delay hotspots:**  
  - Southern Africa (**208 delays**)  
  - West Africa (**206 delays**)  
  - East Africa (**160 delays**)  
- **Average delays:** ~2,000 days for outliers, showing cycle-time challenges

### 📈 Trends
- Disbursements have increased steadily from the early 2000s through the 2020s, showing growing delivery momentum

## 📌 Recommendations
1. **Accelerate disbursement conversion:** Improve project cycle efficiency to raise the **49.9% disbursement ratio**  
2. **Tackle delay hotspots:** Focus interventions in **Southern** and **West Africa**  
3. **Strengthen attribution:** Reduce “None” category by ensuring all projects are tagged to a **region & theme**  
4. **Optimize cycle times:** Use milestone tracking and contractor performance monitoring to address **~2,000-day delays**  
5. **Replicate best practices:** Scale up successful delivery models from East & North Africa into lagging regions

### 📎 Notes
- Replace `your-dashboard-screenshot.png` with your actual dashboard image file name.  
- Update any numeric figures to the final values from your Excel workbook if you make further adjustments.  
- If you'd like, I can also generate a small `README` image banner or add themed badges for each of the High 5 priorities.
