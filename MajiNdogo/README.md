## 📂 Dataset & Methodology
The dataset contained water project records across **five provinces**, covering both rural and urban towns.  

**Steps taken:**  
- 🔹 **Data Cleaning (SQL):** Standardized province/town names, mapped project types, cleaned vendor IDs & cost data.  
- 🔹 **Data Modeling:** Built relational models linking vendors, towns, costs, and project outcomes.  
- 🔹 **Dashboarding (Power BI):** Designed visuals for budgets, project status, completion timelines, and vendor performance.

## 🔎 Key Insights

### 👥 Population Impact  
- **18.3M+ people** benefited from completed projects.  
- Urban towns achieved **100% basic access faster** than rural areas.  

### 💰 Budget vs. Expenditure  
- **Budget Allocation:** ₦146.7M  
- **Actual Spend:** ₦154.4M → **5.29% overrun**  
- Biggest overruns came from **multi-tap installations** and rural repairs.  

### 🌍 Rural vs. Urban Disparity  
- **Rural Projects:** Avg ₦7,310/project  
- **Urban Projects:** Avg ₦3,970/project  
➡ Rural projects are **84% costlier** due to logistics & infrastructure gaps.  

### 🔨 Project Type Analysis  
- **Wells:** High impact, moderate cost.  
- **Taps (6–8):** Major cost drivers (+₦11K–₦17K).  
- **Filtration Systems (RO/UV):** Expensive but critical for water quality.  
- **Repairs:** Low-cost, high-ROI for sustaining access.  

### 🏢 Vendor Performance  
- 20+ vendors evaluated.  
- Efficient vendors: *Kisangani Filter Solutions* & *Mwanza Water Purification* (< ₦2,600 per capita).  
- Others exceeded ₦2,700 per capita → **efficiency gaps identified**.  

### ⏳ Completion Trends  
- Projects spanned **2022–2027**.  
- **Peak completions:** 2024–2025 (aligned with funding cycles).  
- Rural projects → **longest delays** (logistics + costs).

## 📌 Recommendations
1. **Prioritize Rural Communities** – More funding where costs are higher but needs are greater.  
2. **Vendor Optimization** – Partner with proven low-cost, high-impact vendors.  
3. **Control Overspending** – Monitor large tap installations for cost overruns.  
4. **Sustainability Tracking** – Extend monitoring beyond project completion.  
5. **Focus on High-Impact Projects** – Wells & public taps deliver the best ROI.
